# **ChromaTuneMl**
## A visual color gradient control system for adjusting parameters for ML LLMs.
### Here is a link to an article I wrote about the concept:<br>
<p> https://medium.com/@johnmsanti/swarming-towards-truth-adjusting-ml-and-llm-parameters-and-hyper-parameters-with-a-color-0e1b0bf638a7 </p>

### Functionality:
<p>-The concept is to give the user the ability to adjust paramters for training ML models with color gradient nodes which represent data points.</p> 
-possible feature: user establishes a baseline for color gradient and dynamics with a properly trained LLM with ChromaTuneMl run through it.
-Training a new model with the assistance of ChromaTuneMl: 
  The user adjusts parameter weights as usual with ChromaTuneMl running in the background.
  Each each adjusment parameter is attached to a node which is adjustable in 8 directions in 3 dimentional space.
  Each of the 8 directions can represent some "sub weight" for each parameter (depending on the type of metric for that parameter).
  This gives incredible control over the parameter, and allows for multi dimentional algorithmic adjustment within each individual parameter as oposed to linear analog +/-.</p>
