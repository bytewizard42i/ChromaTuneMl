# Basic imports for data handling and operations (Al GPT suggestions)
import numpy as np  # For numerical operations
import pandas as pd  # For data manipulation and analysis

# Machine Learning libraries
import tensorflow as tf  # For building and training ML models
from sklearn import datasets, preprocessing, model_selection  # For data preprocessing and model utilities

# Libraries for Large Language Models
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer  # Hugging Face transformers for LLMs

# 3D Visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Basic 2D plotting, good for initial testing and visualization
import plotly.graph_objects as go  # Advanced 3D plotting, especially useful for web-based applications

# Web framework libraries (if building a web-based application)
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request  # Flask for creating the web server
import socketio  # For real-time communication between client and server

# GUI libraries (for desktop application, choose one)
import tkinter as tk  # Basic Python GUI, easy to use but limited in appearance
from PyQt5 import QtWidgets  # More advanced GUI, greater customization options
import kivy  # Good for applications on multiple platforms (Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, Android)

# Utility libraries
import os  # For interacting with the operating system
import sys  # For accessing system-specific parameters and functions
import json  # For JSON parsing

# Debugging and testing
import unittest  # For unit testing of your application

# Notes:
# - Make sure to install these libraries using pip or conda before running the script.
# - Depending on the specific features you want, you may not need all of these libraries.
# - For real-time 3D visualization, you might also consider integrating with a JavaScript library like three.js.
# - When working with large datasets or complex models, be mindful of computational efficiency and memory usage.
# - Regularly test your application to catch any bugs or issues, especially when integrating multiple libraries.

# Create a Flask app instance if building a web application
app = Flask(__name__)

# Initialize a socketio instance if real-time communication is required
sio = socketio.Server()

# Example: Flask route (uncomment and modify as needed)
# @app.route('/')
# def index():
#     return "Welcome to ChromaTuneML"

# Run the Flask app if this is the main module (uncomment and modify as needed)
# if __name__ == '__main__':
#     app.run(debug=True)
